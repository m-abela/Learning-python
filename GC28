#THE RULES
'''
One contestant selects six of twenty-four shuffled tiles.

The tiles are arranged into two groups: four "large numbers" (25, 50, 75 and 100) (12, 37, 62, 87 in some special episodes)
and the remainder "small numbers", which comprise two each of the numbers 1 to 10.

The contestant chooses how many large numbers are in the selection; anywhere from none to all four.

A random three-digit target is generated by an electronic machine, affectionately known as "CECIL" (
which stands for Countdown Electronic Computer In Leeds).

The contestants then have thirty seconds to get as near to the target as possible by combining the six numbers
selected using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Not all numbers need to be used.

A number can be used as many times as it appears. Fractions are not allowedâ€”only positive integers may be used at
any stage of the calculation
