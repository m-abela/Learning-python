#THE RULES
'''
Letter tiles are arranged face-down in two piles; one all consonants,
the other vowels.

The contestant picks a pile, and Riley reveals the top tile from that pile
and places it on the board. 

A selection of nine tiles is generated in this way, and must contain at least
three vowels and four consonants

Vowels
  A      15  
  E      21  
  I      13  
  O      13  
  U       5  
  Total  67  

Consonants
  B       2  
  C       3  
  D       6  
  F       2  
  G       3  
  H       2  
  J       1  
  K       1  
  L       5  
  M       4  
  N       8  
  P       4  
  Q       1  
  R       9  
  S       9  
  T       9  
  V       1  
  W       1  
  X       1  
  Y       1  
  Z       1
